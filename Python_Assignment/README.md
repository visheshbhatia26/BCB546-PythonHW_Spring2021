# Python Assignment

### This repository serves as a place for all the assignment files. The `sequence_translate.py`, `bears_mass.csv` and `bears_cytb.fasta` are the initial files that were provided to us. They contain all the raw data that was available to us in order to the analysis. 

### `The sequence_translate.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook that contains all the python code while `bears_mass_cytb.csv` is the data frame file.
